Lists files and directories in a given path.

Usage:

- Accepts both absolute and relative paths (relative paths are converted to absolute)
- Returns an empty list if the directory contains no files
- Fails if the path is not a directory or doesn't exist
- You should generally prefer the `bash` tool if you know specific files you want to find or have more complex requirements than simply listing files
