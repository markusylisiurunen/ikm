Use this tool to think through complex problems or brainstorm solutions step-by-step. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the local file system, but just log the thought for you. This tool is your private space to work through ideas, analyze problems, and develop strategies.

When to use this tool:

- Reason through multiple approaches and their trade-offs
- Reflect on what you've learned from exploring files or other documents
- Work through edge cases or potential issues

When NOT to use this tool:

- NEVER immediately after your internal reasoning
- Simple file lookups or basic questions
