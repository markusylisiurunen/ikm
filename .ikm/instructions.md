Please note that a new Go version introduced a shorthand syntax for iterating over integer ranges, which might be more recent than your training data. This syntax allows for loops like the following:

```go
// This loop iterates from i = 0 up to 7
for i := range 8 {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

Keep this newer syntax in mind when generating or discussing Go code involving loops over numerical ranges.
